# Enable Inline Mode for Cricket Dynamic Bot

To enable the search functionality with inline queries, you need to enable inline mode through @BotFather on Telegram.

## Steps to Enable Inline Mode:

1. **Open Telegram** and search for `@BotFather`

2. **Start a chat** with @BotFather

3. **Send the command:** `/mybots`

4. **Select your bot:** Cricket Dynamic Bot (@Cricketdynamic_bot)

5. **Select:** "Bot Settings"

6. **Select:** "Inline Mode"

7. **Select:** "Turn ON"

8. **Optional:** Set inline placeholder text:
   - After enabling, BotFather will ask for a placeholder
   - Suggested text: "Search for players..."
   - This text appears when users click the search button

## After Enabling:

Once inline mode is enabled, the `/search` command will work properly:

1. Users type `/search` in the bot
2. Bot shows "üîç SEARCH ALL THE [PLAYERS] UPLOADED BY CLICKING THE BUTTON BELOW üì±"
3. Users click the "üîç Search Player" button
4. Inline search opens where they can type player names
5. Results appear in real-time as they type
6. Users can tap any result to see card details

## Features:

- **Real-time search** as users type
- **Case-insensitive** matching
- **Partial name** matching (e.g., "virat" finds "Virat Kohli")
- **Popular cards** shown when search is empty
- **Card thumbnails** in search results
- **Detailed information** including rarity, country flags, role

## Troubleshooting:

If inline search doesn't work after enabling:
1. Wait 1-2 minutes for Telegram to update the bot settings
2. Restart the bot if necessary
3. Try the search command again

The bot is currently **RUNNING SUCCESSFULLY** and will work with inline queries as soon as you enable inline mode in @BotFather.
